# Metonym

A ruby gem for [GNews API](https://gnews.io)


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'metonym'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install metonym

## Usage

To be able to send requests to the GNews API, you first must create an account to receive a token [here](https://gnews.io/register.php).

## Query
```ruby
# Establish parameters for query
args = { "q" => "Dragon Ball Super", "country" => "MX", "mindate" => (DateTime.now - 2), 'max' => 1 }

# Send Request
gnews = Gnews::Query.new('my-secret-key')
response = gnews.search(args)

puts response

# =>
```

```json
{  
   "timestamp":1558081205,
   "count_results":1,
   "articles":[  
      {  
         "title":"'Dragon Ball Super' Chapter 48 Release Date, Predictions: Moro Not the Real Villain, Truth Revealed?",
         "desc":"It has been quite a long wait, but it wou ld appear that Dragon Ball Super Chapter 48 will be coming out soon. Along with it is rumored to be a huge bombshell ...",
         "link":"https://www.econotimes.com/Dragon-Ball-Super-Chapter-48-Release-Date-Predictions-Moro-Not-the-Real-Villain-Truth-Revealed-1538175",
         "website":"https://www.econotimes.com",
         "source":"EconoTimes",
         "date":"Fri, 17 May 2019 05:43:46 GMT",
         "image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/CDTeHID-9i5aNWFXTOImYAOOBAFyv8R_QewR4cwP38bycKmVpNS8W-dawVxxumt8FhuzPjXhql8c1y36tkmTaEBW5bCUhryqWH-RBtLnScf_-X8QNL-899A9Sxh2BRpN4Pkp=-c"
      }
   ]
}
```

You can also send a second parmeter to the search method to indicate that the response be parsed to a ruby hash for easier manipulation. By default, the request will respond with a JSON.

```ruby
# Establish parameters for query
args = { "q" => "Game of Thrones", "country" => "DE", 'max' => 1 }

# Send Request with HASH response property
gnews = Gnews::Query.new('my-secret-key', 'hash') 
response = gnews.search(args)

puts response
# =>

{
   "timestamp"=>1558094332, 
   "count_results"=>1, 
   "articles"=>[
      {
         "title"=>"'Game of Thrones' finale: How will it end? Here are a few theories", 
         "desc"=>"", "link"=>"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/game-thrones-finale-popular-theories-end-63057785", 
         "website"=>"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com", 
         "source"=>"GMA", 
         "date"=>"Fri, 17 May 2019 08:06:11 GMT",

      }
   ]
}
